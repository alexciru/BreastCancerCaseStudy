# BreastCancerCaseStudy



##task 

The task of this project is to make a case study of the different classifiers and techniques used in datamining and machine learning and the advantages and disadvantages of each one of them. In order to do that we will using a Breast Cancer Dataset. After the case study we will be able to distinguish the best technique to create a classifier for this data for distinguish between malign and benign tumours. 

Description of the Data base 

For this project I chose the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29 

This breast cancer databases was obtained from the University of Wisconsin, Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.  

This dataset is formed by 11 attributes. Attributes from 2 to10 have been used to represent instances. Each instance has one of 2 possible classes:  benign or malignant. 

 

1. Sample code number:         id number  
2. Clump Thickness:                1 - 10  
3. Uniformity of Cell Size:        1 - 10  
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape:     1 - 10  
5. Marginal Adhesion:              1 - 10  
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size:   1 - 10  
7. Bare Nuclei:                         1 - 10  
8. Bland Chromatin:                 1 - 10  
9. Normal Nucleoli:                  1 - 10  
10. Mitoses:                             1 - 10  
11. Class:                                 benign or malignant 

 

In this dataset we have this class distribution: 

Benign: 458 (65.5%) 
Malignant: 241 (34.5%)
